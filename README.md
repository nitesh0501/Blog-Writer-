# 📝 Blog Writer Web Application

This project is a simple **Blog Writing Platform** where users can:
- ✏️ Write blogs  
- 📖 Read posts  
- 🛠️ Edit existing posts  
- 📤 Upload / Update content  

It is built using **JSP, JDBC, Core Java, and MySQL**, focusing on core web concepts without using advanced frameworks.  
This project helped me understand how backend connectivity, CRUD operations, and server-side rendering work in real-world applications.
